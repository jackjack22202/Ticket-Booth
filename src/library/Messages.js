    Hey Guys,
    <br>Thank you for taking the time to request early access for the Ticket Booth application! Here are a few things that I would like to share with you to help smoothen out your testing experience.
    
    <br><br><strong>Settings</strong>
    
    <br>For the client communication side of the application to operate, we do ask that you provide your API v2 token that is within your monday.com account. This token is needed to display the client's responses, so please keep that in mind when providing your token to avoid confusion. Your token will also be safely stored and encrypted so that only our API can decode it. One thing to remember is that clients responses can experience a delay in being added into a ticket so please be patient.
    
    <br>The settings page of Ticket Booth also allows for further customization of your Ticket List and Ticket Details pages. So please take some time to look around and change these settings to your liking.
    
    <br><br><strong>Bugs</strong>
    
    <br>Currently there is a slight bug with ticket booth that can block you from being able to set out emails to clients. In order to quickly fix this just close your window of monday.com and open a new one. 
    
    <br><br><strong>Future Updates</strong>
    
    <br>Ticket Booth has much room to grow and expand to help suit all monday.com users, and that's why we want your help! All suggestions are welcome and will not go unnoticed, so please feel free to provide feedback for our application in this form. We will soon be releasing an "updates and announcements" page to give everyone an idea of the direction that we will be taking the app. Until then, enjoy the first version of Ticket Booth and remember its just a beta!
